Materials for "Data Science in the Humanities," Spring 2017
===========================================================

This repo is a public supplement to the (private) course Moodle. Students enrolled in the course may find slightly fuller and more up-to-date materials on the Moodle.

Numbered folders contain the materials for specific weeks â€” at least the Jupyter notebooks, and often also slides or lecture notes (when they exist).
